Svelteit is a minimalistic UI/UX component framework for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) projects.

### Why?

Yes, there are many component frameworks out there today, but we wanted our own. If you like our components, use it. If you see a problem, make a pull request or fork your own and roll with it.

### Quick Installation

Add Svelteit to your project by running:

```bash
npm install -D @colorfuldots/svelteit
# or
yarn add @colorfuldots/svelteit --dev
```
